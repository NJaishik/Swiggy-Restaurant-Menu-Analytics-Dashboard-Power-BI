# Swiggy-Restaurant-Menu-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI
I recently built an end-to-end Power BI dashboard to analyze Swiggy restaurant and menu data across multiple Indian cities.

# Key insights delivered:
•	Restaurant coverage and menu depth across 50 cities
•	Category-wise menu distribution and pricing patterns
•	Budget vs Mid-range vs Premium price segmentation
•	City-level analysis highlighting pricing differences, restaurant density, and menu availability

# What I focused on:
•	Clean KPI design for quick decision-making
•	Multi-page dashboard layout for better storytelling
•	Proper use of DAX, slicers, and Top N filtering
•	Avoiding misleading visuals caused by inconsistent data

This project strengthened my skills in Power BI development, data modeling, and business-focused visualization.
